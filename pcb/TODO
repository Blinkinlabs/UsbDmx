For RevB:
x-drop power injector (skipped, still need it)
x-Switch to ground-plane based design
x-Fix RJ45 connector layout
x-Make board larger to make space for mounting holes
x-Switch to 0603 components, 2520 crystal
x-switch to longpads version of processor for easier assembly
x-hook status lines up to Arduino RX/TX (skipped, don’t care)
x-Move ICSP header so it doesn’t conflict with USB

For RevC:
-add in-line power fuse like the Leonardo
-Fit into a pre-made case?
-Put status LEDs into ethernet connector?
